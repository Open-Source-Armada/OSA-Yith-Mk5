# OSA-Yith-Mk4
The latest version of OSA's 8 gun fighter, remade into a 1k light fighter.

The Mk4 Yith is the next iteration of my main fighter, remade from the ground up to be in a lower weight class of ship, while still retaining the same firepower, 1k weight was the goal so that the ship qualified for Kais 3v3 tournement.

//Specs//

8 mounted weapons with a staggered fire trigger system.

Shoot_1+ and Shoot_2+ are your triggers, bind these to your weapon hotkey (space by default).

Rapidfire button switches between staggered fire (gun 2 will stagger behind gun 1 creating a machine gun effect) and alpha strike (both guns fire together).

CenterSensePlus and CenterSenseMinus is your standard sensitivity, Adjust both to your prefered flying senitivity.

AimMax- and AimMin- is your Aim hotkey, Bind both to the same keybind, this will lower your sensitivity, Adjust MinSensePlus and MinSenseMinus to change Aim sensitivity.

AimMax+ and AimMin+ is your Boost hotkey, Bind both to the same hotkey, this will raise your sensitivity, Adjust MaxSensePlus and MaxSenseMinus to change Boost sensitivity.

Ship is set to both fly and aim at a smooth sensitivity (tune to your taste), Boost keybind removes these limits allowing for faster pitch/yaw, Aim keybind lowers the limits for sniping.

This can be altered to be the more common method of aiming, having higher sense as standard, and having the ships pitch/yaw slow down for aiming. (Swap the BoostMin/BoostMax Off values with its On values, remember to set it in the pitch/yaw lever fields too)

Armoured using known methods of meta plating, including big plate health, voxel armour, segmented and layered plating and plasma/rail sacrifice plates.

Materials and components are on the high end, i leave it to the user to reduces cost to your tastes.
